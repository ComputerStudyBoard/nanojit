Nanojit
=======

Nanojit is a small cross platform C++ library that emits machine
code. It was originally part of Adobe's Tamarin ActionScript VM. It is
also used by Mozilla in their 'TraceMonkey' JavaScript implementation.

I'm using it in a couple of my projects so I pulled the source out of
those projects and made it into its own repository. The current source
was refreshed from Mozilla's mozilla-central repository at commit id
968dfb (http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central).

I'll periodically update from the original repositories to get bug
fixes and improvements.

Build
=====

A makefile is provided. It currently only builds a version of nanojit
for x86 machine code generation. Feel free to tweak, submit patches,
etc to fix this.

Documentation
=============

See the documentation at the Mozilla developer site:

  https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Nanojit

The example program from that documentation is in the 'example'
subdirectory.
